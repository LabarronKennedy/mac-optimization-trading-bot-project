# MacBook Optimization & Automated Trading Bot Project

## Summary
Documenting my work optimizing MacBook system performance and developing a fully automated trading bot (MetaTrader 5 / MQL5).

## System Optimization Process

### Goals:
- Resolve system slowdown and battery drain on MacBook Pro
- Optimize WiFi stability and overall system performance

### Actions Taken:
- Diagnosed high CPU usage (`suggestd` process at 96%) using Activity Monitor
- Performed Spotlight index rebuild to restore normal CPU load
- Validated battery health (Normal)
- Reset and optimized WiFi network configuration
- Result: System runs faster, battery life improved, stable WiFi connection

## Automated Trading Bot Development

### Project Focus:
- Built and debugged a custom automated trading bot in MQL5 for MetaTrader 5
- Core strategy includes:
    - Higher timeframe trend & order block detection (1H/4H)
    - Lower timeframe entries (M5/M15)
    - RSI-based overbought/oversold filtering
    - Dynamic lot sizing and risk management
    - Trailing stop-loss with automated profit-taking
    - Backtested and refined for stable performance

## Tools & Technologies
- macOS Utilities (Activity Monitor, Spotlight, Terminal)
- MetaTrader 5 (MT5), MQL5
- TradingView integration
- Forex trading strategy (Order block, RSI, risk management)
