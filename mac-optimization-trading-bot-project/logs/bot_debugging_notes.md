# Bot Debugging Notes

## Initial Issues
- Multiple compiler errors in MQL5 bot code.
- Trailing stop logic not functioning correctly.
- RSI filter implementation needed tuning.

## Debugging Process
1. Iteratively corrected MQL5 syntax errors.
2. Implemented trailing stop logic and tested.
3. Verified RSI filter and integrated entry logic.
4. Conducted backtesting in MT5.
5. Validated bot performance in live MT5 environment.

## Next Steps
- Implement advanced news filter.
- Refine session-based trading logic.
